## JBCNConf 2019

Last Monday, May 27, began the JBCNConf in Barcelona one of the biggest and important conference about the JVM in Spain.
I went as attendee and enjoyed the talks very much. 
As I couldn't go to all of them, I've been looking for the slides of all the talks so I can save them and read them with ease.
Below I will list all the ones I found or I attended.
Besides, I'll attach some pictures that I taken in some talks.
