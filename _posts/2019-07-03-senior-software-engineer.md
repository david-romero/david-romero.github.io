## The Senior Software Engineer

I've just finished the book 'The Senior Software Engineer' of [David Bryant](https://twitter.com/davetron5000), and I think is a really good book for any software developer who wants to know what really seniority means. Some developers think that to be a senior software engineer is related to the years that he or she is has been working in software engineering and I have always thought that this concept is a mistake. David Bryant thinks the same than me, and besides, he proposes several capabilities that a real senior software engineer must have.
