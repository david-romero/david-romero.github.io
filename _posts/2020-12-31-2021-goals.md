![Goals]({{ "/img/goals.jpg" | absolute_url }})

In the same way that in the last years,  I'm going to make a retrospective of my year reviewing my goals and checking if I fulfilled my objectives. 

The first step is to review the year in a personal and professional way and if I have met the goals that I set for myself.

Here we go with my 2020's summary.

2020 was a pandemic year so, all my plans blew up, and I had to change my mind and take a step-by-step approach. 

- I managed to finish a marathon. <i class="fa fa-trophy" style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</i>
- I started a new step in my career working at Packlink.
- I moved to Aracena, Spain, my home town.
- I've been working from home since February.

Now, time to review the goals

1. **Learn English seriously.** <i class="fa fa-warning" aria-hidden="true" title="In Progress" style="color: orange;font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;In Progress</i> I have not been able to fulfill this objective, however, I'm attending twice a week to English lessons, so even though my English level has not improved, I'm training several times in the week with a great teacher which allows me to improve my English level. Besides, in Packlink, I have a lot of coworkers who speak in English, so I'm training a lot, and I hope to have major progress this year. 
2. **Read books** <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" title="Done" style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Done!</i> Great job with this goal! More than ten books per year is a great number. I know that reading one book every month is not an impressive number but for me, it's a great stride.
3. **Contribute to an open-source project.** <i class="fa fa-warning" aria-hidden="true" title="In Progress" style="color: orange;font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;In Progress</i>  This aim has not been completed at 100 % but I have done huge improvements. I've been researching some open source projects in order to learn how to contribute and besides, I've released my first library which integrates Cucumber & Micronaut. https://github.com/david-romero/cucumber-micronaut
4. **Publish at least six posts.** <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" title="Failure" style="color: red;font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;To-Do</i> This year has been very difficult in mental strength so, I wasn't able to publish any post to the blog.

With the lesson learned from last year and what I want to be in 2021, these are my goals for the new year.

1. **Learn English seriously.** This goal has to be the most important in 2021 again, I must learn as much as possible. I think I have had major progress that I must strengthen and maintain in 2021. Furthermore, I should complete this goal in order to be comfortable in Packlink, so this is a must-have.
2. **Contribute to an open-source project & maintain cucumber-for-micronaut library** The most beautiful goal. One of my ambitions in my professional life. I want to contribute to one of the most famous open-source projects like Spring Framework, Jenkins, Elastic, etc... There are a lot of issues labeled as `good for beginners` so I have to research in the GitHub repositories and contribute to those projects. I would like to solve all issues in my library and release new versions with new features.
3. **Read books.** Last year I read 6 books, so this year I have to read even more. I should combine personal and professional books. I have to keep the same pace.
4. **Publish at least six posts** My blog was the great forgotten last year, and therefore I have to resume this beautiful task. Maybe, I could post my progress with Scala and some recaps of the books that I read.

From a personal point of view, I'm working from home 100 %, so I have to improve my communication skills, and my productivity to take advantage of this amazing opportunity. 

Technical goals:

- Improve my productivity with MAC.

- Learn Scala

- Learn Functional Programming paradigm.

Let's do that!  <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
