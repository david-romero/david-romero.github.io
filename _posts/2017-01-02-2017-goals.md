![Goals]({{ "/img/goals.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Yesterday, first of January, I read the [Bonilista's newsletter](http://www.bonillaware.com/objetivos-para-2017) ] how every Sunday, for more than 6 months, and it made me think thant I should also make a list with my goals for the new year, and at the same time analyze how gone 2016 because I need to know how the year has gone to know if I'm on the right track or if I've lost my way.

Here we go with my summary of 2016

At the professional level it has been a very good year due to my great progression in my company. I have learned a lot, I have programmed everything I have wanted and more, I have introduced new technologies in the company, I have introduced new concepts needed in a software factory and most importantly I have been happy. On the contrary, I have suffered a lot of stress due to high workload and not knowing how to disconnect from work.

On a personal level, the truth is that I have no achieved milestones, mainly for being very focused on my professional life.

* I have not managed to obtain a certification in English, that is, I have to learn English seriously.
* I have not managed to lead a healthier life.
* I forgot a bit my family and couple.
* I have not published anything in this Blog.

In relation to my needs, these are my goals for 2017.

1. **Work from home one day a week.** This objective I think is important because I like to work with my timing, with my schedule and 100% focused on work, therefore, I am happy. I think it can be achieved because the company is facilitating this possibility and therefore it is something that I should take advantage of.
2. **Learn to disconnect from work.** A great burden that haunts me since I started working. If there is not something I can do, that helps me lose time, that helps me read and write, that I like it more, that it does not disconnect me more irascible
3. **Lead a healthier life.** Due to the high level of stress suffered in 2016, food and health has not been a priority for me in the wake of states of anxiety and to carry out a feeding sometimes harmful. This can not happen in 2017 and I must put many means into it.
4. **Learn English seriously.** Nowadays I can not afford the luxury of not speak English at a high level. There are no excuses and we must remedy it. No more If I achieve this goal I will get an official certification, so get to work.
5. **Attend conferences, talks and events related to the software.** Last year I followed from Twitter, with much envy, many events related to the software community, like tarugoconf, codemotion, sevilla-jam, agile spain, etc ... If I want to continue learning and growing in this community I must learn from better and it is clear that the best are in those events.

Honestly, they come to my head 5 or 6 more goals but I think I have to be realistic and focus on what is most important in order to achieve all the objectives.

Let's do it that I've been a day late ðŸ™‚
